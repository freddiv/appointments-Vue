# appointments-Vue
My first Vue application built using Vue and bootstrap imported from cdn

- Application is build with Vue.js and Bootstrap4 loaded via calls to the cdn repositories.
- The application is initialized with 3 default appointments.
- Data storage is currently using local browser storage using parsed json objects
  - This will require a modern browser to view correctly
  - Any appointments added will only persist for the user who enteres them
  - data can be cleared using dev tools
  
### Additional Features

**New features will be being added **
- To support noSql DBs MongoDB support will be supported first
- The ability to delete appointment will be added
- Editing of current appointment entries will be allowed
